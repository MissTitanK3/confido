# Corporate Site Rebuild

## Overview
Following the success of our recent meet and greet, I have embarked on an exciting project to rebuild the corporate website. This initiative aims to reflect where I currently stand in my career and showcase my expertise in modern web development practices.

## Goals
The primary objectives of this rebuild are:

- **Modern UI Best Practices**: Introducing some of my personal best practices in user interface design to enhance the overall user experience.
- **Dark Mode Implementation**: Integrating dark mode to provide an optimal viewing experience in low-light environments and to cater to user preferences.
- **Showcasing Career Progression**: Demonstrating my growth and capabilities in web development through a modern, responsive, and aesthetically pleasing corporate website.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the website looks great and functions perfectly on devices of all sizes.
- **Enhanced User Interface**: Applying contemporary UI principles to create an intuitive and engaging user experience.
- **Dark Mode**: Offering a dark mode option to improve usability in low-light conditions and reduce eye strain.
- **Optimized Performance**: Utilizing best practices in coding and performance optimization to ensure fast load times and smooth interactions.

## Note
Given the short timeframe, some of the current features on the corporate site may not be included in the initial rebuild. However, I am committed to building as much as I can within the available time.
